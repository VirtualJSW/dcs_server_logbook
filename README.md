# DCS Server Logbook

## Description

DCS Server Logbook is a Lua-based project designed for use with DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) servers running Slmod. This project processes and combines statistical data generated by Slmod, offering a comprehensive view of individual pilot performance and overall server activity.

## Features

- **Statistical Data Merging**: Integrates data from multiple Slmod-generated Lua files into a unified dataset.
- **Pilot Performance Analysis**: Calculates and displays detailed statistics for each pilot, including flight time and combat effectiveness.
- **HTML Report Generation**: Creates individualized HTML reports for pilots, showcasing their contributions and activity on the server.

## File Structure

- `main.lua`: Central script for handling data parsing, merging, and report generation.
- `merge.lua`: Handles the merging of data from multiple Lua files.
- `pilots.lua`: Generates detailed HTML reports for individual pilots.
- `utils.lua`: Provides utility functions supporting various operations of the project.
- `html/`: Directory for storing generated HTML reports.

## Setup

1. Ensure Lua is installed on your DCS server.
2. Clone the repository to the server:

```
git clone https://github.com/engines-wafu/dcs_server_logbook.git
```
3. Place Slmod statistics files (e.g., `SlmodStats_server1.lua`, `SlmodStats_server2.lua`) in the designated directory.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory on your server.
2. Execute the main script:

```
lua main.lua
```

3. The script will process Slmod data and generate HTML reports in the `html/` directory.

## Customization

- Modify `main.lua` to adjust input files or processing steps.
- Update `merge.lua` for specific data merging requirements.
- Adapt `pilots.lua` for custom HTML report formats.
